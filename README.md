# EduFree – Free Education Platform

EduFree is a full-stack web application developed to support a non-profit initiative that provides **free and quality education** to children in rural communities through volunteer-driven learning.

The platform enables volunteers to upload educational content, while admins review and approve the content to maintain quality before it is made available to learners.
